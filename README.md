# Doubly linked list with extra functionality
It's based on the C++ STL list data structure, with some extra functionalities like: 
- replacing every element equal equal to a given element
- removing every element equal to a given element
- inserting before/after a given position
- inserting an element N times before/after a position
- removing an element before/after a given position
- removing elements between two positions
- every function has its reversed type (performs like the list was numbered backwards)
